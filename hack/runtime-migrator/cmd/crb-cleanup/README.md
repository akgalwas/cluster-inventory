# CRB Cleanup script

This script is used to clean up provisioner's ClusterRoleBindings (CRBs) after migration.
It looks for provisioner and KIM CRBs, compares them,
and if all of the provisioner's CRBs have a KIM equivalent, it removes the provisioner's ones.

The cleanup script is run locally, with kubeconfig pointing to the cluster.

| `-output`           | Output dir for created logs.                                | _empty_ (acts like `./ `)                                                                          |

| `-force`            | Delete provisioner CRBs even if they have no kim equivalent | `false`                                                                                            |

> [!NOTE]
> if `-output` doesn't end with `/`, the name of the files will be prefixed with last segment.
> eg. `-output=./dev/log/cluster_a-` will create files like `./dev/log/cluster_a-missing.json`, `./dev/log/cluster_a-removed.json`, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> without `-dry-run=false` the script won't delete anything, even with a `-force` flag

## Usage

To run cleanup script, execute:

```bash
go run ./cmd/crb-cleanup -output=./dev/logs/my-cluster/ -kubeconfig=./dev/kubeconfig -dry-run=false
```

If there are missing CRBs, the script will print a list of them and exit with a zero status code.
Missing CRBs can be inspected as JSON in `./dev/logs/my-cluster/missing.json`. No CRBs will be removed.

After inspecting the missing CRBs, you can re-run the script with the `-force` flag to delete them.

If no CRBs are missing, the script will remove provisioner CRBs.
Removed CRBs can be inspected as JSON in `./dev/logs/my-cluster/removed.json`.

If any errors occured during deletion (eg. permission error), the CRBs that failed will be listed in `./dev/logs/my-cluster/failures.json`.

All of the log files will be created either way.

### prefixing logs in `kcp taskrun`

Create a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
crb-cleanup -output=./logs/${RUNTIME_NAME}_ -dry-run=true
```

When run, the script will create files like `./logs/some_runtime_missing.json`

### `-dry-run` mode

When running the script without `-dry-run=false` flag, CRBs that _would_ be removed will be listed as JSON in `./dev/logs/my-cluster/removed.json`.
No destructive actions will be performed.
